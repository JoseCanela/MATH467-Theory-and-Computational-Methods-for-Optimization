# Final Project
## Implementing the simplex method to solve general linear programming problems and comparing L1 and L2 approximation
This project consisted of three parts.

1. Implementaton of the basic simplex method to solve standard linear programming problems.

2. Implementation of the simplex method to solve general linear programming (GLP) problems.

3. Studying the similarities and differences between L<sup>1</sup> vs. L<sup>2</sup> approximation using 10-year U.S. Treasure Interest (TNX) and Dow Jones stock index price (DJI) data from 11/05/15 to 12/3/18.
